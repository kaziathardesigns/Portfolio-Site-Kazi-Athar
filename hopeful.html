      <p>
        We’ve all been there! Depressed, sad, heartbroken or lonely. Such is life sometimes. However, in every crisis lies an opportunity. An opportunity for growth. An opportunity to learn. An opportunity to forgive and an opportunity to be hopeful.

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Hopeful is a responsive website that helps people suffering from depression, anxiety, sadness, loneliness or any other issue by connecting them to a therapist of their choosing.
      </p>

      <h2>Workflow</h2>

      <h2>1.Defining the Problem</h2>

      <p>
        The initial part of my workflow is always about defining the problem. This includes possible problems and possible solutions to those problems. I then describe the concept and formulate a problem statement and using all the insights gathered I craft a solution statement.
      </p>

      <h2>The Concept</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>There aren’t that many platforms out there that connect people suffering from mental health issues to professionals</li>
        <li>Some of the platforms focus more on meditation than therapy</li>
        <li>The platforms that do provide mental health support don’t provide any free content to the users</li>
        <li>Users lose motivation easily since meditation is hard practice</li>
        <li>People are fearful of being judged by their friends and family if they reach out for help</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

      <p>
        Our users need to find a way to get access to licensed professional help because apps nowadays lack human element to them that doesn’t tackle the problem from the core. We will know this to be true when we see users downloading and sticking to our products using analytics and the number of sessions sold.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution Statement</h2>

      <p>
        A responsive website that lets people book online sessions with a therapist or a relevant professional of their liking. Users can schedule and pay for their session online. In addition to that, the website will offer free content such as Sleepcasts. These not only provide free content but also facilitate users to sleep better and bring their anxiety levels down.
      </p>

      <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>

      <p>
        The two competitors I chose for the analysis were Headspace and Present. Both these apps are meditation based and the insights I gathered from this analysis are as follows.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Insights</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Users lack human connection while interacting with digital products</li>
        <li>Users don’t want to commit to a monthly subscription plan</li>
        <li>Headspace provides users with free content that engages them</li>
        <li>Present has a pricey plan at 40€ per month and will not engage users</li>
        <li>Present uses gamification to retain users</li>
        <li>Opportunity lies in creating a platform where the users can connect with real psychologists to cope with anxiety</li>
      </ul>

      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>2. Understanding the User</h2>
      <p>
        I started out with preparing a test script and plan for my interviews. I picked out 3 people who have been to therapy or have used a meditation app to interview. The interviews were mostly about people’s motivations, experiences and frustrations with the current platform they are using. Following that I did affinity mapping to put everything into perspective. Here’s a picture to showcase my findings.
      </p>

      <h4>Affinity Mapping</h4>

          <img srcset="img/hopeful/affinity-mapping-1200.jpg" alt="Affinity mapping">
      </picture>

      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>People are having difficulties with slow processing times using governmental institutions</li>
        <li>Prices are very high for private institutes</li>
        <li>Location seems to be a big issue as people don’t want to travel far</li>
        <li>People have to go through an assessment phase to actually get to talk to a therapist</li>
        <li>Digital platforms are not primary means of reaching out for help (in Finland)</li>
        <li>Websites have discoverability issues</li>
        <li>Free consultation is available in order to get a feel for the therapist</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Way Forward</h4>

      <p>
        Based on the insights gathered from the people I interviewed, there is definitely a potential for a digital platform that would facilitate people in consulting a therapist for whatever issue they might encounter. The price seems to be another issue that people take into consideration. If we can offer people simple yet affordable means of getting therapy then from the looks of it, people would gladly use the product.
      </p>

      <h4>User Personas</h4>

      <p>
        It’s time to introduce the personas, meet Carla and Jodie. They are both at a different stage in their lives which translates into different motivations, goals, frustrations and needs.

      <h4>User Journeys</h4>

      <p>
        I designed user journeys based on my findings and observations from the personas. These take us through the entire process of what a user does and feels while interacting with the product.

      <h4>User Stories and Flows</h4>

      <p>
        Following user journeys I made user stories and flows. These were based on the most important aspects on the app, such as;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Booking an appointment with a therapist</li>
        <li>Listening to a Sleepcast</li>
      </ul>
